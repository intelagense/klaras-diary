These systems typically use microfabrication techniques to create tiny mirrors, lenses, and other components that can manipulate light and perform a variety of functions, such as sensing, imaging, and communication. MOEMS technology has applications in fields such as telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and environmental monitoring."
